# Traveling to Bishop, California

## When to Visit

Bishop is a high altitude temperate steppe climate, with hot and dry summers and cool & snowy winters.  Average highs for summer are 97F in July and average lows for winter are 24 F in December.  Because of this, I would recommend mid to late fall or the early spring as the best time to visit.  Timing a visit in the fall can be difficult, as you will need to time the heat breaking and balance that with ensuring the summer forest fire smoke has cleared the valley, whereas I have personally found spring visits to be more predictable.  In March the snow will have melted just about everywhere except the tops of the eastern sierra, and it is unlikely that temperatures will exceed 80 F during the day, making for great hiking and climbing weather.


## Where to stay


### Camping

There are two spots I would recommend for camping in Bishop:

Just down Buttermilk road past the parking lot to the **Buttermilk Boulders** is some USFS land that permits dispersed camping for up to 14 consecutive nights, free of charge.  There are a series of pullouts that can accommodate groups, with the first one to the right being the largest which can accommodate at least a dozen cars.  There is a pit latrine at the buttermilks, but I would certainly recommend bringing extra toilet paper. This area can get very cold in the winter, compared with the valley below.

An alternative is the **Pleasant Valley Pit campground** which is located just west of the Happy Boulders. This area has clean toilets and trash disposal accommodation, and the price is only $5 per campsite per night.  The campsites have fire rings and picnic tables, a definite upgrade from random BLM camping spots, but the area can get extremely windy so be sure to stake down tents and place heavy objects inside of them


### Hotels

Plenty of hotels along the main strip of 395 in Downtown Bishop, as well as the Eastside Guesthouse, a popular climber hostel.  


### AirBnB

Vacation rental inventory in Bishop is relatively low, which drives the prices up in the area.  Something to consider if it is important that you stay in a house with a large group is that nearby Mammoth is only 45 minutes away, and has a much better selection of vacation rentals.  


## What to Eat

One thing I love about Bishop is that for a small mountain town the food selection is excellent, likely because of its presence as a common stop for 395 travelers.  


### Groceries

Probably the best and easiest spot for grocery shopping in Bishop is the Vons, which will be familiar to southern california residents (and the same as Safeway for northern california residents.) In addition to groceries, Vons is a great place to get firewood and camping supplies.

Other notable mentions should include: 

**Manor Market** off Line Street, which for a small grocery store has an good selection of higher end foods, as well as a great wine and beer selection.  

**Grocery Outlet** for cheap bulk food items if on a budget

**Mercado Mexico** for mexican grocery specialties, as well their excellent taco counter.


### Bakeries and Delis:

You can't go to Bishop without a visit to **Erick Schatz Bakkerÿ**, with its extensive selection of breads, meats and cheeses.  The deli counter serves decent sandwiches and there are counters serving up donuts, breakfast sandwiches and other pastries.  While this spot can be extremely touristy with long lines extending out the door, its worth a visit if for nothing else than their immaculately clean bathroom.  Everyone loves to shit at Schatz™.

Personally I find the sandwiches at **Great Basin Bakery** to be superior, and some of their bread trade blows with Schatz.  The shop is not as eclectic and you will have less selection, but what they do they do well.   \

### Restaurants

Burger Barn is the spot to go for a traditional dinner of burgers and shakes. Don’t forget to round off the meal with a side of 

Holy Smoke Texas BBQ

 \
If you like generic but good american style pizza with a fun bar setting to enjoy a pint with your friends, then **Pizza Factory** is a great choice.  While not everyone is a fan of their pizza, I have a soft spot for their pizza and it will always be my choice over other options in town.

**The Rolling Chef 395** is a food truck with a blended cuisine of cuban and south american foods, with a heavy peruvian influence.  These dishes really swing for the bleachers, with the pan empingao being a quick favorite, especially doused in the chimichurri, aji verde or aji de habeñero.

Mercado Mexico. 


### Coffee

**Blacksheep** is my go-to coffee shop, with good joe and excellent staff.  There outside at the rear of the building which isn’t the best, but seems appropriate for an in-town pit stop for the campers among us.  I am a big fan of the foil-wrapped breakfast burritos which come in meat and vegetarian varieties.
