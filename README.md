# Traveling to Bishop, California

## When to Visit

Bishop is a high altitude temperate steppe climate, with hot and dry summers and cool & snowy winters.  Average highs for summer are 97F in July and average lows for winter are 24 F in December.  Because of this, I would recommend mid to late fall or the early spring as the best time to visit.  Timing a visit in the fall can be difficult, as you will need to time the heat breaking and balance that with ensuring the summer forest fire smoke has cleared the valley, whereas I have personally found spring visits to be more predictable.  In March the snow will have melted just about everywhere except the tops of the eastern sierra, and it is unlikely that temperatures will exceed 80 F during the day, making for great hiking and climbing weather.

## Getting to bishop

### By Plane  

There are three major airports each a similar distance away:

Reno-Tahoe Airport (3.5 hours north)
Las Vegas McCarran Airport (4 hours south east)
Bob Hope Airport (4.5 hours south west)

Additionally, there is a smaller airport in Mammoth only 45 minutes to the north, but flights are limited and not offered every day.  

If you happen to own your own general aviation aircraft, you could also fly into Bishop's Eastern Sierra Regional Airport
(KBIH).

### By Car

To access Bishop by car, you can approach on 395 from the north or south.  The southern approach is recommended in winter months with heavy snow, as the route has lower elevations and roads are not likely to close in a winter storm. To access the northern approach from the SF Bay area, there are a series of passes that traverse the sierra, listed below in order of most likely to be closed during a winter storm:

* Tioga Pass (Hwy 120) is an incredibly scenic drive through the Yosemite National Park and Tuolumne Meadows, but this road closes permanently for the winter, generally between November and May
* Sonora Pass (Hwy 108) often closes for much of the winter, but occasionally reopens in gaps between storms due to plowing
* Carson Pass (Hwy 88) is generally open except for major snow storms
* Kingsbury Pass and Luther pass (Hwy 50 to 207 or 89, respectively) are occasionally open when all the passes to the south are closed
* Donner Pass (I-80) is the least likely pass to close, given its interstate status, but still occasionally closes for a few days each year.  If you're forced to go this route, you might consider the southern approach instead, cutting through Tehachapi Pass.

## Where to stay


### Camping

There are two spots I would recommend for camping in Bishop:

Just down Buttermilk road past the parking lot to the **Buttermilk Boulders** is some USFS land that permits dispersed camping for up to 14 consecutive nights, free of charge.  There are a series of pullouts that can accommodate groups, with the first one to the right being the largest which can accommodate at least a dozen cars.  There is a pit latrine at the buttermilks, but I would certainly recommend bringing extra toilet paper. This area can get very cold in the winter, compared with the valley below.

An alternative is the **Pleasant Valley Pit campground** which is located just west of the Happy Boulders. This area has clean toilets and trash disposal accommodation, and the price is only $5 per campsite per night.  The campsites have fire rings and picnic tables, a definite upgrade from random BLM camping spots, but the area can get extremely windy so be sure to stake down tents and place heavy objects inside of them


### Hotels

Plenty of hotels along the main strip of 395 in Downtown Bishop, as well as the Eastside Guesthouse, a popular climber hostel.  


### AirBnB

Vacation rental inventory in Bishop is relatively low, which drives the prices up in the area.  Something to consider if it is important that you stay in a house with a large group is that nearby Mammoth is only 45 minutes away, and has a much better selection of vacation rentals.  


## What to Eat

One thing I love about Bishop is that for a small mountain town the food selection is excellent, likely because of its presence as a common stop for 395 travelers.  


### Groceries

Probably the best and easiest spot for grocery shopping in Bishop is the Vons, which will be familiar to southern california residents (and the same as Safeway for northern california residents.) In addition to groceries, Vons is a great place to get firewood and camping supplies.

Other notable mentions should include:

**Manor Market** off Line Street, which for a small grocery store has an good selection of higher end foods, as well as a great wine and beer selection.  

**Grocery Outlet** for cheap bulk food items if on a budget

**Mercado Mexico** for mexican grocery specialties, as well their excellent taco counter.


### Bakeries and Delis:

You can't go to Bishop without a visit to **Erick Schatz Bakkerÿ**, with its extensive selection of breads, meats and cheeses.  The deli counter serves decent sandwiches and there are counters serving up donuts, breakfast sandwiches and other pastries.  While this spot can be extremely touristy with long lines extending out the door, its worth a visit if for nothing else than their immaculately clean bathroom.  Everyone loves to shit at Schatz™.

Personally I find the sandwiches at **Great Basin Bakery** to be superior, and some of their bread trade blows with Schatz.  The shop is not as eclectic and you will have less selection, but what they do they do well.   

**Mahogany Meats** Need to review




### Restaurants

**Burger Barn** is the spot to go for a traditional dinner of burgers and shakes. Don’t forget to round off the meal with a side of

While unlikely to win any awards at a BBQ competition, I am a big fan of the meals available at **Holy Smoke Texas BBQ**,

If you like generic but good American style pizza with a fun bar setting to enjoy a pint with your friends, then **Pizza Factory** is a great choice.  While not everyone is a fan of their pizza, I have a soft spot for their pizza and it will always be my choice over other options in town.

If higher-end pizza is something you're looking for, **The Upper Crust Pizza** has pricy but high quality pizza pies for sale.  While a bit high end for a large group of smelly climbers, this spot is an easy splurge choice.

**The Rolling Chef 395** is a food truck with a blended cuisine of Cuban and South American foods, with a heavy Peruvian influence.  These dishes really swing for the bleachers, with the pan empingao being a quick favorite, especially doused in the chimichurri, aji verde or aji de habeñero.

**Mercado Mexico**, as mentioned above, has an excellent taco counter.  This is the spot for you if you need a good burrito.

The **Thai Thai Restaraunt** has decent and affordable Thai food, with excellent outdoor seating right along the flight line of KBIH Airport.  If you've been spoiled by SF Bay Area Thai food like me, you might not be impressed by the food, but I found that while presentation might be lacking, the food was delicious and well made.


### Coffee

**Blacksheep** is my go-to coffee shop, with good joe and excellent staff.  There outside at the rear of the building which isn’t the best, but seems appropriate for an in-town pit stop for the campers among us.  I am a big fan of the foil-wrapped breakfast burritos which come in meat and vegetarian varieties.  

### Bars

The **Mountain Rambler** is a great spot for a pint after a long day outdoors, and their food selection - while expensive - is excellently prepared.  

### Fast food
I completely understand and I don't shame. I'm a climber, and I love Taco Bell myself.  Given the town's pit stop nature, there are a variety of fast food locations in town including:
* Taco Bell
* McDonalds
* El Pollo Loco
* Jack in the Box
* Carls Junior
* KFC
* Dominos
* Subway

## What to do


### Bouldering

This guide will by no means replace a good dedicated climbing guidebook, I recommend picking one up from [Eastside Sports](https://eastsidesports.com/collections/climbing-guidebooks).  Instead I'll try to provde a general overview fo the different climbing areas to consider.

#### Happy Boulders

This wide and long canyon has a variety of volcanic stones to ascend, with a convenient warmup area near Monkey Hang (V2/V3) at the entrance.  Park along Chalk Bluff Road and hike up a steep and sandy trail which serves as a brief cardio warmup for the day.

#### Sad Boulders

The Sad Boulders by contrast are in a much narrower canyon to the east of the Happy Boulders along Chalk Bluff Road

#### Buttermilk Boulders

This is highball country, and the climbs are definitely not easy even for intermediate climbers.  

#### Pollen Grains

#### Druid Stones

### Rope climbing

#### Owens River Gorge


### Hiking

**Bishop Pass** is a great hike starting from South Lake, and traveling as far as you'd like for a day trip out and back. The distance Bishop Pass is 5 miles and 3,000 feet of climbing, while the distance to the John Muir Trail junction at Le Conte Ranger Station is 10 miles - most likely too much for a day hike for most people.

Just past Aspendell is **Lake Sabrina** has a number of short hikes to the surrounding lakes, such as Blue lake, Midnight Lake, and Donkey Lake.

While in Bishop you might consider bagging what most consider to be the easiest 14'er in California: **White Mountain**.  With a 15 mile out and back hike and only 3,300 feet of ascent, this hike is much easier than nearby Whitney to the south. Best part: no permit is needed.

If you're in town solely for instagram clout, then **Big Pine Lake** is a must stop, with its beautiful blue waters worth the 16 mile hike.
